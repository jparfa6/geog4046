          <p>The new Wonders of the World were selected in 2007. The selection process involved voting on 200 monuments that exist throughout the world.There are traditionally 7 Wonders of the World. However, an 8th was selected as an "Honorary Wonder". The Honorary Wonder is the only remaining member of the Ancient Wonders of the World. </p>
            <p1>This map shows the locations of the new Wonders of the World. The shapes of the wonders are color coded to represent the time period they were constructed; purple shapes indicate they were constructed before A.D. 1, pink shapes were constructed between A.D. 1 and A.D. 1000, blue shapes were constructed between the years 1001 and 1899, and green shapes were constructed post 1900. </p1>
