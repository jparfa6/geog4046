          <p>The word mythology comes from the Greek word mythos for story-of-the-people and these stories exist all over the world to explain the unexplainable, creation stories, or the consequences of unethical behavior.  </p>
            <p1>This map focuses on monsters of mythology, though these stories originated where they are on the map, many of them exist in different forms all over the world. As people migrated, they took their myths with them and this map can helpl you to see how far they've traveled! </p1>
