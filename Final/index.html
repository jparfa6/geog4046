        <h1 class="subtitle">The United Houma Nation at Catfish Lake</h1>
          <p>The United Houma Nation is a tribe of Indigenous peoples living along 6 of the coastal parishes of Louisiana. Lafourche Parish accounts for the second largest population of tribal members who settled near the small community of Golden Meadow. Catfish Lake has always been an important place to tribal people as an abundant source of food. There was once a settlement near the north-west area of the lake, though its land and location have been lost to time. Oil and gas exploration expedited land loss in these small communities with dredging and spills. By using GPS equipped cameras and traveling on boats with tribal members, we hope to document the changing landscape and areas of significance from their perspective. </p>
            <p1>With the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) projecting substational land loss in the best of scenarios, we hope to document what remains and embolden an Indigenous perspective for the future.</p1>
